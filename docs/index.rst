COSIMA Cookbook
===============

Welcome to the COSIMA Cookbook!

This repository is a Cookbook of Recipes 👩🏽‍🍳 👨🏻‍🍳.

We explain: a "recipe" here is an example of an analysis of some ocean-sea ice model output or some ocean-related observational datasets.
Each "recipe" comes in a self-contained and well-documented Jupyter notebook.
All the recipes combined form a cookbook 📒!

Happy cooking! 😉 🥙 🍱 🍲

To get started you should first take the :doc:`Cooking Lessons 101 <cooking-lessons-101/index>` (i.e., our Tutorials).
After you've gone through them and feel comfortable, browse through the
available Recipes (i.e., examples) to find something the better suits your 'taste' (i.e., your needs)!

The recipes are split into :doc:`appetisers` (i.e., easier/simpler recipes -- a good place
to start after you've been through the :doc:`cooking-lessons-101/index`), :doc:`mains`
(i.e. more elaborate/advanced recipes) and :doc:`local-dishes` (i.e. recipes for regional
configurations).

The  :doc:`COSIMA Cookbook tutorial <01-Cooking-Lessons-101/01-Basics/COSIMA_CookBook_Introduction>` is perhaps the best place to start.
