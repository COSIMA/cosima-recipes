COSIMA Cookbook
===============

Welcome to the COSIMA Cookbook! 

This repository consists a Cookbook of Recipes 👩🏽‍🍳👨🏻‍🍳.
We explain: a "recipe" here is an example of a model output (or observational dataset) analysis that we can perform.
Each "recipe" consists of a self-contained, and self-documented Jupyter notebook.
All the recipes combined form a cookbook 📒!

To get started have a look at the tutorials_ and then browse through the
available recipes_ to find something the better suits your needs!
