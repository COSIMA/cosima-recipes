COSIMA Cookbook
===============

Welcome to the COSIMA Cookbook!

This repository is a Cookbook of Recipes 👩🏽‍🍳 👨🏻‍🍳.

We explain: a "recipe" here is an example of an analysis of some ocean-sea ice model output or some ocean-related observational datasets.
Each "recipe" comes in a self-contained and well-documented Jupyter notebook.
All the recipes combined form a cookbook 📒!

Happy cooking! 😉 🥙 🍱 🍲

To get started have a look at the tutorials_ and then browse through the
available recipes_ to find something the better suits your 'taste' (i.e., your needs)!
The  `COSIMA Cookbook tutorial`_ is perhaps the best place to start.
