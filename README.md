# cosima-recipes
Example recipes using the cosima-cookbook infrastructure.

To **Get Started** with the COSIMA Cookbook, clone this repository to your local file space.
This will give you a bunch of examples with which you can begin to construct your own analysis code.
If your code is useful, then **contributions back to the repository are always welcome**.

## Tutorials
This directory contains a notebook (`COSIMA_CookBook_Tutorial.ipynb`) that outlines the basic philosophy of the COSIMA Cookbook. Best to start here if you can. Also some other tutorials regarding the cookbook (e.g., `Make_Your_Own_Database.ipynb`) or more general (`Making_Maps_with_Cartopy.ipynb`).

## Documented Examples
This directory includes some notebooks for simple diagnostics which are well-documented and explained. If you can find an example that suits your purpose, this is the best place to start.

## Contributed Examples
This directory contains a number of examples which are valuable, but not commented sufficiently to make it into DocumentedExamples. An aspirational goal is to eliminate this class of example.

## Sandbox
See here for a hotch-potch of old and new contributed files that may or not be useful or operational. Use at your own risk!
