# cosima-recipes
Example recipes using the cosima-cookbook infrastructure.

To **Get Started** with the COSIMA Cookbook, clone this repository to your local file space.
This will give you a bunch of examples with which you can begin to construct your own analysis code.
If your code is useful, then **contributions back to the repository are always welcome**.

## [Tutorials](https://cosima-recipes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/index.html)

This directory contains a notebook (`COSIMA_CookBook_Tutorial.ipynb`) that outlines the basic philosophy of the COSIMA Cookbook. Best to start here if you can. Also some other tutorials regarding the cookbook (e.g., `Make_Your_Own_Database.ipynb`) or more general (`Making_Maps_with_Cartopy.ipynb`).

Don't miss out the [tutorial](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/COSIMA/cosima-recipes/blob/master/Tutorials/Using_Explorer_tools.ipynb?flash_cache=True) about using `cosima_cookbook`s `explore` submodule to find out about available experiments and variable in a database. (The `explorer` tutorial is better viewed either via nbviewer or by running the jupyter notebook yourself.)

## [Documented Examples](https://cosima-recipes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/documented_examples/index.html)
This directory includes some notebooks for simple diagnostics which are well-documented and explained. If you can find an example that suits your purpose, this is the best place to start.

## Contributed Examples
This directory contains a number of examples which are valuable, but not commented sufficiently to make it into DocumentedExamples. An aspirational goal is to eliminate this class of example.

## Sandbox
See here for a hotch-potch of old contributed files that may or not be useful or operational. Use at your own risk!
