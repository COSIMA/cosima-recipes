# cosima-recipes
Example recipes using the [`cosima-cookbook`](https://github.com/COSIMA/cosima-cookbook) infrastructure.

To **Get Started** with the `cosima-cookbook`, clone this repository locally, probably best in your local space on one of the NCI HPC machines so you can have access to model output. The repository includes a bunch of examples with which you can begin to construct your own analysis code.

### Contributing

If you made a notebook for analysing something that is not already included in the recipes, then please consider **contributing back to the repository**.

To make a contribution follow the steps laid out in the [beginner's guide on how to contribute](
https://cosima-recipes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html). If they sound intimidating then don't worry!
Just raise [an issue](https://github.com/COSIMA/cosima-recipes/issues) explaining briefly what the contribution you want to make is and we'll help out with the process!

## Repository contents

### [Tutorials](https://cosima-recipes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html)

The notebook `COSIMA_CookBook_Tutorial.ipynb` outlines the basic philosophy of the `cosima-cookbook`. This is the best place to start if you are not familiar with the `cosima-cookbook`. Also included here are some other tutorials, either related to the cookbook (e.g., `Make_Your_Own_Database.ipynb`) or more general (`Making_Maps_with_Cartopy.ipynb`).

Don't miss out the <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/COSIMA/cosima-recipes/blob/master/Tutorials/Using_Explorer_tools.ipynb" target="_blank">tutorial</a> about using `cosima-cookbook`'s `explore` submodule to find out about available experiments and variables in a database. (The `explorer` tutorial is better viewed either via nbviewer or by running the jupyter notebook yourself.)

### [Documented Examples](https://cosima-recipes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/documented_examples.html)
Νotebooks for simple and not-so-simple diagnostics which are well-documented and explained. If you can find an example that suits your purpose, this is the best place to start.

### ACCESS-OM2-GMD-Paper-Figs
Νotebooks to reproduce (as far as possible) the figures from the [ACCESS-OM2 model announcement paper (*GMD*, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-401-2020). These notebooks are mostly uncommented, but they should be functional. They are intended to demonstrate methods to undertake the calculations used in the paper.

### Contributed Examples
Α number of examples which are valuable, but not commented sufficiently to make it into DocumentedExamples. An aspirational goal is to eliminate this class of example.
