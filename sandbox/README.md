People can throw here code they are working on, code that is not documented, draft notebooks, etc.

Users should use this code with caution; the code found here hasn't been reviewed to assure it is correct or it even runs properly!

A good working hypothesis is that all code/notebooks found here are undocumented, outdated and/or deprecated. If you feel that this is not the case, e.g., for a particular notebook, then please consider opening a PR to move that notebook into `DocumentedExampes`.)
