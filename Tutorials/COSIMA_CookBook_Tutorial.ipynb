    "It is designed to:\n",
    "* Provide examples of commonly used diagnostics;\n",
    "* Write efficient, well-documented, openly accessible code;\n",
    "* Encourage community input to the code;\n",
    "* Ensure diagnostic results are reproducible;\n",

    "\n",
    "There are two different ways for you to access the database:\n",
    "1. You can use the default database, which is periodically refreshed automatically. This database sits in `/g/data3/hh5/tmp/cosima/database/access-om2.db` and should be readable for all users. It includes all experiments stored in the COSIMA data directory under project `hh5` on NCI. The examples in this tutorial use this database.\n",
    "2. Otherwise, you can make your own database, which is stored in your own path and includes only the experiments you are interested in. Please refer to the `Make_Your_Own_Database` tutorial for instructions on how to create this database.\n",
