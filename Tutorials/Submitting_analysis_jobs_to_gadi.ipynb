    "# Submitting analysis jobs to gadi\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook goes through an example of how to convert your jupyter notebook code into a PBS job you can submit to Gadi, NCI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, once you have your analysis working in a jupyter notebook and you are using a lot of data, it can be helpful to submit the job directly to Gadi. This uses the PBS queue (see NCI website for more details, https://opus.nci.org.au/display/Help/4.+PBS+Jobs). It means the job is not interactive, but it also means you can submit many jobs at the same time if say you want to break up your analysis and run one year/month at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to set up this analysis is to convert your `.ipynb` notebooks into `.py` files, and then run on gadi with a wrapping `.sh` bash script. Functions and packages that work in your `.ipynb` notebooks, such as `cosima_cookbook` should also work on gadi. `dask`, however, requires some special treatment; see the CLEX CMS team's article on this for more information (https://coecms-training.github.io/parallel/dask-batch.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to \n",
    "1. set up your `.py` script to use `dask` stably\n",
    "2. set up your PBS script\n",
    "3. Optional: add an environment variable for easy submission of different months/years/variables"
